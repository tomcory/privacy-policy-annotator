  "legal_text": "Article 13(2)(f): The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\nArticle 14(2)(f): The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\nArticle 22(1): The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.\n\nRecital 60: The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they should be machine-readable.\n\nRecital 71: The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes 'profiling' that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or where necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller, or where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concern a child. In order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved, and that the personal data are not disclosed unauthorised persons. Such measure should not concern a child.

  "commentary": "When automated decision-making or profiling produces legal effects or significantly affects data subjects, the controller must inform them about the existence of such processing, the logic involved, and the consequences. This includes decisions made without human intervention that affect things like credit applications, job applications, or personalized pricing. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that the information should be meaningful and understandable to data subjects, not overly technical. Data subjects have the right to human intervention, to express their point of view, and to challenge automated decisions. The controller must also explain the safeguards in place and how data subjects can exercise their rights. This requirement promotes transparency and accountability in automated decision-making systems.",
  "plain_summary": "When organizations use computers to make decisions about people (like approving loans, setting prices, or recommending products), they must tell people about it and explain how the system works. This includes decisions made entirely by computer without human involvement. People must be told what information the system uses, how it makes decisions, and what the consequences might be. They also have the right to have a human review the decision, to explain their side, and to challenge automated decisions. This is important because automated decisions can significantly affect people's lives.",
