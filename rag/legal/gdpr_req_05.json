  "legal_text": "Article 13(1)(c): The purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.\n\nArticle 14(1)(c): The purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.\n\nRecital 60: The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they should be machine-readable.\n\nRecital 61: The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to them at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are collected from another source, within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided.",
  "commentary": "The purpose of processing must be clearly and specifically stated, not vague or overly broad. Each purpose should be described in a way that data subjects can understand what their data will be used for. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that purposes should be 'specific, explicit and legitimate' and that controllers should avoid using generic purposes like 'business purposes' or 'improving services'. The purpose statement should be granular enough to allow data subjects to understand the specific use case. If there are multiple purposes, each should be clearly identified. The purpose must be determined at the time of collection and cannot be changed without informing the data subject.",
  "plain_summary": "Organizations must clearly explain why they are collecting and using personal data. This means describing the specific purpose in plain language that people can understand - like 'to process your order', 'to send you marketing emails', or 'to provide customer support'. Vague purposes like 'business purposes' or 'improving services' are not acceptable. Each purpose should be specific enough that people know exactly how their information will be used.",
