  "legal_text": "Article 13(2)(b): The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to such processing and the existence of the right to data portability.\n\nArticle 14(2)(c): The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to such processing and the existence of the right to data portability.\n\nArticle 17(1): The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: (a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; (b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; (c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2); (d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed; (e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; (f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).\n\nRecital 65: A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a 'right to be forgotten' where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nRecital 66: To strengthen the 'right to be forgotten' in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In doing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's request for erasure.",
  "commentary": "The right to erasure (also known as the 'right to be forgotten') allows data subjects to request deletion of their personal data in specific circumstances. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that this right is not absolute and must be balanced against other rights and interests. Controllers must respond without undue delay and inform any recipients of the data about the erasure request. The right applies when data is no longer necessary, consent is withdrawn, processing is unlawful, or for other specified reasons. Controllers must also take reasonable steps to inform other controllers processing the data about the erasure request. However, the right does not apply when processing is necessary for legal compliance, public interest, or other legitimate grounds.",
  "plain_summary": "People have the right to ask organizations to delete their personal data in certain situations. This includes when the data is no longer needed, when they withdraw their consent, when the data was collected illegally, or when they were under 16 when they gave consent. Organizations must respond quickly and also tell any other companies they shared the data with about the deletion request. However, this right is not absolute - organizations can keep data if they need it for legal reasons, public interest, or other legitimate purposes. This right is sometimes called the 'right to be forgotten'.",
