3) **"User Choice/Control"**: Practice that describes general choices and control options available to users. e.g. "You can opt out of marketing emails"
4) **"User Access, Edit and Deletion"**: Privacy practice that allows users to access, edit or delete the data that the company/organization has about them. e.g. "You can request deletion of your account"
5) **"Data Retention"**: Privacy practice specifying the retention period for collected user information. e.g. "We retain your data for 30 days"

## Review Guidelines

The annotations were generated by an automated system and may contain errors. Your task is to carefully evaluate the correctness, accuracy and completeness of the provided annotations and correct them if necessary. If you deem an annotation correct, leave it unchanged. If you find an annotation to be incorrect, incomplete or superfluous, correct or delete it. If you find that any annotations are missing, add them.

The given annotations were generated based on the guidelines listed below. Reference these guidelines carefully when revising the annotations. For each annotation, ask yourself:

1) "Is the annotation label valid, i.e. does it appear in the list of 9 OPP-115 privacy practice categories given above, or do I need to correct it?"
3) "Does the annotated span actually address the stated privacy practice category, or do I need to remove it?"
2) "Does the annotation cover the correct span or do I need to adjust the annotated span by adding or removing some words?"
4) "Does the annotation fulfil all of the guidelines listed below?"
5) "Are there any other spans that need to be annotated to fully capture all OPP-115 privacy practice categories addressed by this passage?"

### General Annotation Guidelines

- Carefully consider the provided list of privacy practice categories to ensure that you correctly identify the relevant phrases.
- Annotate only the passage itself, do not annotate the provided context items. Use the provided context items only to get a better understanding of the passage.
- Do not annotate general introductions and explanations or references to other sections or documents (e.g. "cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer" or "refer to the section 'Your Rights' for more information" should not be annotated).
- Annotations rarely cover entire passages or sentences; annotate the smallest phrase that conveys the necessary meaning to fulfil a Privacy Practice Category (e.g. in the sentence "We collect device identifiers for analytics.", only annotate "device identifiers" as **First Party Collection/Use**).
- Less is more: if you are unsure whether a phrase is relevant, it is better to leave it out.
- Generally, headlines should not be annotated if it is apparent that they merely introduce a section of the policy.
- In your output, do not correct any spelling or grammar mistakes present in the annotated text.
- Never make up information that is not present in the text.
- Never make up new privacy practice categories that are not part of the provided list.

### Linguistic and Grammatical Instructions

- Include restrictive/defining clauses in the annotation (e.g. "**your** email address", "**our** advertising partners", "**third-party** services").
- A passage may address multiple different privacy practice categories. Thus, a passage may have any number of annotations (e.g. "we collect your email address to contact you" contains a **First Party Collection/Use** ("your email address") and a **User Choice/Control** ("contact you")).
- Multiple phrases in the same passage may address the same privacy practice category; annotate each phrase separately (e.g. "we collect IP addresses and device models" contains two instances of **First Party Collection/Use**: "IP addresses" and "device models").
- A single word or phrase may have multiple annotations if it clearly addresses multiple categories (e.g. "you can opt out of marketing emails" could be both **User Choice/Control** and **First Party Collection/Use** if the context supports both interpretations).
