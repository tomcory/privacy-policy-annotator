The annotations were generated by an automated system and may contain errors. Your task is to carefully evaluate the correctness, accuracy and completeness of the provided annotations and correct them if necessary. If you deem an annotation correct, leave it unchanged. If you find an annotation to be incorrect, incomplete or superfluous, delete or correct it. If you find that an annotation is missing, add it.

The annotations were generated based on the following guidelines. Follow these guidelines carefully when reviewing the annotations:

- Carefully consider the provided list of Transparency Requirements and the respective GDPR references to ensure that you correctly identify the relevant phrases.
- Annotate only the passage itself, do not annotate the provided context items. Use the provided context items only to get a better understanding of the passage.
- Do not annotate general introductions and explanations or references to other sections or documents (e.g. “cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer" or "refer to the section 'Your Rights' for more information” should not be annotated).
- Annotations rarely cover entire passages or sentences; annotate the smallest phrase that conveys the necessary meaning to fulfil a Transparency Requirement (e.g. in the sentence “We log device identifiers.”, only annotate “device identifiers” as **Data Category**).
- Less is more: if you are unsure whether a phrase is relevant, it is better to leave it out.
- Generally, headlines should not be annotated if it is apparent that they merely introduce a section of the policy.
- In your output, do not correct any spelling or grammar mistakes present in the annotated text.
- Never make up information that is not present in the text.
- Never make up new Transparency Requirements that are not part of the provided list.
- Include restrictive/defining clauses in the annotation (e.g. “**your** name”, “**other** companies **we are affiliated with**”, “**our** partners”).
- A passage may address multiple different Transparency Requirements. Thus, a passage may have any number of annotations (e.g. “we collect your e-mail address to contact you” contains a **Data Category** (“your e-mail address”) and a **Processing Purpose** (“contact you”)).
- Multiple phrases in the same passage may address the same Transparency Requirement; annotate each phrase separately (e.g. “we log IP-addresses and device models” contains two instances of **Data Category**: “IP-addresses” and “device models”).
- A single word or phrase may have multiple annotations (e.g. “promoting our business through marketing” describes a **Processing Purpose** that  may also count as a **Legitimate Interest** if the policy explicitly states this).
- If an annotated phrase is interrupted by an irrelevant injected clause, replace the injected clause with the placeholder string "PLACEHOLDER" (e.g. “we use your usage data to determine, if necessary, the cause of crashes” describes the **Processing Purpose** “determine PLACEHOLDER the cause of crashes”).
- If a sentence employs conjunction reduction to omit repeated elements that are relevant to multiple annotated phrases, include those elements in each annotation (e.g. “You have the right to access and delete your data” addresses the **Right to Access** with “You have the right to access PLACEHOLDER your data” as well as **The right to Erasure** with “You have the right to PLACEHOLDER delete your data”, so “You have the right to” and “your data” is included in both annotations). This also applies to shared restrictive/defining clauses (e.g. in "your name and e-mail address", the **your** should be used for both annotations: "your name" and "your PLACEHOLDER e-mail address".
- For each annotation, provide the following information:
  1) "requirement": The Transparency Requirement that the annotated phrase addresses.
  2) "value": The annotated phrase itself.
  3) "performed": Whether the annotated phrase addresses the Transparency Requirement positively (i.e. the phrase explicitly states the information) or negatively (i.e. the phrase explicitly states the absence of the information).
