  "legal_text": "Article 13(2)(b): The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to such processing and the existence of the right to data portability.\n\nArticle 14(2)(c): The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to such processing and the existence of the right to data portability.\n\nArticle 20(1): The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where: (a) the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1); and (b) the processing is carried out by automated means.\n\nRecital 68: The data subject should have the right to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject that have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.",
  "commentary": "The right to data portability allows data subjects to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller. This right applies only when processing is based on consent or contract and is carried out by automated means. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that the data must be provided in a format that is commonly used and machine-readable (like CSV, JSON, or XML). The right includes both receiving the data and having it transmitted directly to another controller where technically feasible. This right promotes competition and gives data subjects more control over their data. However, it does not apply to processing based on legal obligations, public interest, or legitimate interests. The right should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.",
  "plain_summary": "People have the right to get a copy of their personal data in a format they can easily use and transfer to another company. This applies when the organization processes their data based on their consent or a contract with them, and the processing is done by computer. The data must be provided in a common format (like a spreadsheet or text file) that can be read by other systems. People can also ask the organization to send their data directly to another company if it's technically possible. This right helps people switch between services more easily and gives them more control over their data. However, it doesn't apply to all types of data processing.",
