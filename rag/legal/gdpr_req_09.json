  "legal_text": "Article 13(2)(a): The period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.\n\nArticle 14(2)(a): The period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.\n\nArticle 5(1)(e): Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject ('storage limitation').\n\nRecital 39: Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.",
  "commentary": "The retention period must be clearly specified, either as a fixed period or as criteria for determining the period. The period should be the minimum necessary to fulfill the processing purposes. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that retention periods should be specific and not open-ended. When exact periods cannot be determined, clear criteria must be provided (e.g., 'until the end of the business relationship plus 7 years for legal compliance'). The retention period should be linked to the specific processing purpose. Controllers must have a process for reviewing and deleting data when the retention period expires. The retention period should be realistic and justifiable, not excessive. Different categories of data may have different retention periods based on their purpose and legal requirements.",
  "plain_summary": "Organizations must tell people how long they will keep their personal data. This should be a specific time period (like '2 years' or 'until you close your account') or clear criteria for when the data will be deleted (like 'until the end of our business relationship plus 7 years for tax purposes'). The retention period should be the minimum time needed for the stated purpose. Organizations can't keep data indefinitely without a good reason. They must also have a process to actually delete the data when the time period is up.",
