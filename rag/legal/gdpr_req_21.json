  "legal_text": "Article 13(2)(d): The existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\n\nArticle 14(2)(e): The existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\n\nArticle 77(1): Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation.\n\nRecital 141: Any data subject who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation should have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered. Any controller involved in processing should be held liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes this Regulation. A controller should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member State law. Data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered. Where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing, each controller or processor should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that full and effective compensation is ensured for the data subject. Any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation should be compensated by the controller or processor, who may be exempted from liability if they prove that they are not responsible for the damage, in accordance with the principle of liability of the controller or processor established in this Regulation.

  "commentary": "Data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if they believe their personal data has been processed in violation of the GDPR. They can complain to the authority in their country of residence, place of work, or where the alleged violation occurred. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that this right is fundamental and must be clearly communicated to data subjects. The supervisory authority will investigate the complaint and can take various actions, including ordering the controller to stop processing, imposing fines, or requiring corrective measures. Data subjects also have the right to seek judicial remedies and compensation for damages. This right ensures that data subjects have effective means to enforce their rights and hold controllers accountable for violations.",
