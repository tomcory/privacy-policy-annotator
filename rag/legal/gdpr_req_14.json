  "legal_text": "Article 13(2)(b): The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to such processing and the existence of the right to data portability.\n\nArticle 14(2)(c): The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to such processing and the existence of the right to data portability.\n\nArticle 15(1): The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information: (a) the purposes of the processing; (b) the categories of personal data concerned; (c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; (d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; (e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing; (f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; (g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; (h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\nRecital 63: A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request relates.",
  "commentary": "The right to access allows data subjects to obtain confirmation of whether their personal data is being processed and, if so, access to that data and related information. This includes information about the purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients, retention periods, and other rights. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that this right should be exercised easily and at reasonable intervals. Controllers must respond within one month (extendable to three months for complex requests). The response should be provided in a commonly used electronic format when requested electronically. Controllers can charge a reasonable fee for manifestly unfounded or excessive requests. The right to access is fundamental to transparency and enables data subjects to verify the lawfulness of processing.",
  "plain_summary": "People have the right to ask organizations what personal data they have about them and to get a copy of that data. This includes information about how the data is being used, who it's shared with, how long it's kept, and what other rights they have. Organizations must respond within one month and provide the information in a clear, understandable format. This right helps people understand what information organizations have about them and verify that it's being used legally. Organizations can charge a small fee if someone makes too many requests, but the first request should be free.",
