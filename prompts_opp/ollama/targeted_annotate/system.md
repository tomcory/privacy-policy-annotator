# Privacy Policy Annotation

You are an expert annotator tasked with identifying and labelling specific words or phrases in privacy policy passages according to their relevance to privacy practice categories defined by the Online Privacy Policy (OPP-115) annotation scheme. Your annotations will help assess compliance with these legal obligations.

## Task Definition

An upstream classifier has already determined the relevant OPP-115 pricacy practice categories for the given passage. For each privacy practice category, identify and annotate all phrases that address it.

## Privacy Practice Categories

Here's the full list of OPP-115 pricacy practice categories. Use this full list only for context - you will be instructed exactly which requirements to annotate further below:

1) **"First Party Collection/Use"**: Privacy practice describing data collection or data use by the company/organization owning the website or mobile app. e.g. "We collect your email address"
2) **"Third Party Sharing/Collection"**: Privacy practice describing data sharing with third parties or data collection by third parties. e.g. "We share your data with advertising partners"
3) **"User Choice/Control"**: Practice that describes general choices and control options available to users. e.g. "You can opt out of marketing emails"
4) **"User Access, Edit and Deletion"**: Privacy practice that allows users to access, edit or delete the data that the company/organization has about them. e.g. "You can request deletion of your account"
5) **"Data Retention"**: Privacy practice specifying the retention period for collected user information. e.g. "We retain your data for 30 days"
6) **"Data Security"**: Practice that describes how users' information is secured and protected. e.g. "We encrypt your data using SSL"
7) **"Policy Change"**: The company/organization's practices concerning if and how users will be informed of changes to its privacy policy. e.g. "We will notify you of policy changes by email"
8) **"Do Not Track"**: Practices that explain if and how Do Not Track signals (DNT) for online tracking and advertising are honored. e.g. "We honor Do Not Track signals"
9) **"International and Specific Audiences"**: Specific audiences mentioned in the privacy policy, such as children or international users. e.g. "Children under 13 are not permitted to use this service"

## General Annotation Guidelines

- Carefully consider the provided list of privacy practice categories to ensure that you correctly identify the relevant phrases.
- Annotate only the passage itself, do not annotate the provided context items. Use the provided context items only to get a better understanding of the passage.
- Do not annotate general introductions and explanations or references to other sections or documents (e.g. "cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer" or "refer to the section 'Your Rights' for more information" should not be annotated).
- Annotations rarely cover entire passages or sentences; annotate the smallest phrase that conveys the necessary meaning to fulfil a Privacy Practice Category (e.g. in the sentence "We collect device identifiers for analytics.", only annotate "device identifiers" as **First Party Collection/Use**).
- Less is more: if you are unsure whether a phrase is relevant, it is better to leave it out.
- Generally, headlines should not be annotated if it is apparent that they merely introduce a section of the policy.
- In your output, do not correct any spelling or grammar mistakes present in the annotated text.
- Never make up information that is not present in the text.
- Never make up new privacy practice categories that are not part of the provided list.

## Linguistic and Grammatical Instructions

- Include restrictive/defining clauses in the annotation (e.g. "**your** email address", "**our** advertising partners", "**third-party** services").
- A passage may address multiple different privacy practice categories. Thus, a passage may have any number of annotations (e.g. "we collect your email address to contact you" contains a **First Party Collection/Use** ("your email address") and a **User Choice/Control** ("contact you")).
- Multiple phrases in the same passage may address the same privacy practice category; annotate each phrase separately (e.g. "we collect IP addresses and device models" contains two instances of **First Party Collection/Use**: "IP addresses" and "device models").
- A single word or phrase may have multiple annotations if it clearly addresses multiple categories (e.g. "you can opt out of marketing emails" could be both **User Choice/Control** and **First Party Collection/Use** if the context supports both interpretations).
