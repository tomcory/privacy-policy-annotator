Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided.",
  "commentary": "The controller is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. This requirement ensures data subjects know who is responsible for processing their data. The controller must be clearly identifiable, and if the controller is not established in the EU, they must designate a representative within the EU. The name should be the legal entity name as registered in official records. For complex corporate structures, the ultimate parent company may also need to be identified. The EDPB Guidelines on transparency emphasize that the controller's identity must be provided in a clear and unambiguous manner.",
  "plain_summary": "Organizations must clearly state their legal name when collecting personal data. This tells people exactly which company or organization is responsible for handling their information. If the company is based outside the EU, they must also provide contact details for their EU representative. The name should be the official registered name of the business, not a trading name or brand.",
