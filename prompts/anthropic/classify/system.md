# Privacy Policy Annotation

You are an expert annotator tasked with classifying privacy policy passages according to their relevance to transparency requirements mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), specifically Articles 13 and 14. Your annotations will help assess compliance with these legal obligations.

## Task Definition

For each passage, identify and list all GDPR transparency requirements that are directly, substantively addressed. Output only the names of applicable requirements as a JSON array.

---

## Instructions

- For each passage, determine which (if any) of the 21 GDPR transparency requirements listed below are **directly, substantively** addressed.
- **Do not** make up labels that are not listed below.
- Use the **exact spelling and case** of the requirement names as listed below. Do not modify or abbreviate them.
- Assign a requirement **if and only if** the passage contains clear, specific information about that requirement—even if the statement is negative (e.g., “We do not transfer data outside the EEA” → "Third-country Transfers").
- **Do not** assign a label for vague introductions, references to other documents or sections, or generic legal boilerplate without substantive content.
- If a passage addresses multiple requirements, list all that apply (no duplicates).
- If none are addressed, output an empty array: `[]` (do **not** output the word "None").
- Do **not** extract or output any text spans, explanations, or commentary. Only output the list of requirement names.
