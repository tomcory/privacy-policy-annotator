You are a privacy policy expert. Your task is to analyse the text snippet given below and determine whether it is likely part of a privacy policy or whether it's from another HTML document. General terms of service do not count as privacy policies! 

Respond with only a single word, omit any additional explanations or context: 

'true' if you are sure that the snippet is part of a privacy policy, 
'false' if you are sure that it is not, and 
'unknown' if there's not enough information to decide.
