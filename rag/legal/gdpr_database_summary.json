Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller when personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject that have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.",
    "commentary": "The right to data portability allows data subjects to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller. This right applies only when processing is based on consent or contract and is carried out by automated means. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that the data must be provided in a format that is commonly used and machine-readable (like CSV, JSON, or XML). The right includes both receiving the data and having it transmitted directly to another controller where technically feasible. This right promotes competition and gives data subjects more control over their data. However, it does not apply to processing based on legal obligations, public interest, or legitimate interests. The right should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.",
    "plain_summary": "People have the right to get a copy of their personal data in a format they can easily use and transfer to another company. This applies when the organization processes their data based on their consent or a contract with them, and the processing is done by computer. The data must be provided in a common format (like a spreadsheet or text file) that can be read by other systems. People can also ask the organization to send their data directly to another company if it's technically possible. This right helps people switch between services more easily and gives them more control over their data. However, it doesn't apply to all types of data processing.",

The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\n\nRecital 42: Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which concerns other matters, the request for consent should be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that withdrawal should be possible through the same method used to give consent, and controllers should not make withdrawal unnecessarily difficult. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing that occurred before withdrawal. Controllers must inform data subjects of this right before they give consent. The withdrawal should be effective immediately, though some processing may continue if there is another legal basis. Controllers should provide clear and accessible ways to withdraw consent, such as unsubscribe links or account settings.",
    "plain_summary": "When organizations process personal data based on someone's consent, that person has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Withdrawing consent must be just as easy as giving it in the first place. The organization must tell people about this right before they give consent. When someone withdraws consent, the organization must stop processing their data for that purpose, but any processing that happened before the withdrawal remains legal. Organizations should make it easy to withdraw consent, such as through unsubscribe links or account settings.",
