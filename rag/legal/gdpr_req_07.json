  "legal_text": "Article 13(1)(d): Where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party.\n\nArticle 6(1)(f): Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nRecital 47: The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller when personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.\n\nRecital 60: The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they should be machine-readable.",
  "commentary": "When relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis, the controller must clearly state what those specific interests are. The legitimate interests must be real and not speculative, and must not override the data subject's fundamental rights and freedoms. Common legitimate interests include fraud prevention, network security, direct marketing (with opt-out rights), and business administration. The EDPB Guidelines emphasize that the legitimate interest must be clearly identified and explained in a way that data subjects can understand. The controller must also consider whether the data subject would reasonably expect such processing. The legitimate interest must be balanced against the data subject's rights and interests, and this balancing exercise should be documented.",
  "plain_summary": "When organizations rely on 'legitimate interests' as a legal basis for processing data, they must clearly explain what those interests are. This means stating the specific business reasons why they need to process the data, such as preventing fraud, ensuring security, or improving their services. The organization must also consider whether these interests are more important than the person's privacy rights. Common legitimate interests include fraud prevention, security, and direct marketing (though people must be able to opt out of marketing). The explanation should be clear and specific, not vague.",
