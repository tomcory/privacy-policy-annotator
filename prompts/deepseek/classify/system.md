# Privacy Policy Annotation

You are an expert annotator tasked with classifying privacy policy passages according to their relevance to transparency requirements mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), specifically Articles 13 and 14. Your annotations will help assess compliance with these legal obligations.

## Task Definition

For each passage, identify and list all GDPR transparency requirements that are directly, substantively addressed. Output only the names of applicable requirements as a JSON array.
